// the InferencePool selects across all three roles, so an unlabeled or
// mislabeled encode/prefill pod would otherwise be accepted as a decode
// candidate; label-selector-filter's matchExpressions has no such exception.

// route (envoy-3-epp.yaml) is what dispatches each EPP-Profile value to the right
// EPP. The openai-parser/vllmhttp-parser request handler matches the single-EPP
// config so the generate path (vllm-http wire format) is parsed the same way.
