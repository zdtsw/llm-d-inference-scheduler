# AGENTS.md

llm-d Router. Go service that routes inference requests to model-serving pods via an Endpoint Picker (EPP), with a sidecar that coordinates disaggregated inference. Multi-vendor open source under the llm-d project. Review bandwidth is a shared community resource, so scope work tightly and discuss substantive changes in the open before code lands.

`make help` lists targets. `make presubmit` is the pre-merge gate. All targets run inside a builder container; host Go is not required.

## Agent operating rules

**Allowed.** Edit code, run `make` targets, read the codebase and GitHub state.

**Ask first.** Pushing commits to any branch (including feature branches), rewriting pushed history, edits under `.github/` or to `OWNERS`, dependency upgrades. When asking, propose the specific change and the reason in one message; do not start the work in the same turn.

**Never, without explicit per-turn authorization.** Public actions under the user's identity: GitHub comments, reviews, reactions, PR state changes, label or reviewer assignment, posts to Slack or any external surface. Draft such replies as quoted text for the user to send. Authorization is per-action and does not carry between actions or to sub-agents.

## Working in the codebase

- State your interpretation before coding. When the task has multiple valid reads, ask; don't pick one silently. For clear failure signals (logs, failing tests, reproducer), act; the ask rule is about unclear requirements, not unclear bugs.
- Define success as a checkable outcome: "add validation" becomes "write failing tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass". Where the issue is reproducible, the failing test IS the success criterion; write it first and let it gate the implementation.
- Before changing or extending a component, read an analogous one in the repository. The closest existing implementation is the canonical pattern; follow its structure, naming, and tests rather than introducing new conventions.
- The plugin model is the main extension surface. Start at [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md); existing filters, scorers, and profile handlers are the canonical references.
- Tests in the same package describe the contract. Read them before changing behavior.
- Verify behavior against the code, not from filenames or familiarity. Run the build or read the test when uncertain.
- Do not claim work is complete without running `make presubmit` (or the targeted test) and confirming the relevant output. "Tests pass" is a claim, not a fact, until the command output exists.
- If execution goes sideways (unexpected state, cascading failures, a fix that breaks adjacent code), stop and replan. Restate what you know, identify where the plan broke, propose a revised path before continuing.

## Pull requests

- Minimalism: smallest correct change inside the smallest scope.
- Non-trivial work must be tracked in an issue. If there isn't one, ask the user to file or link it.
- The PR addresses that issue and nothing else: no renames, reformatting, refactors, new abstractions, or pattern changes beyond what the issue requires.
- Unrelated improvements belong in their own issue and PR, not folded into this PR. If you spot dead code or unrelated bugs in passing, mention them; don't fix them.
- Self-check on the way out: if the change grew larger than expected or the fix feels hacky, rewrite the clean version before opening the PR.
- Verify the code passes `make presubmit` locally before submitting a PR.
- Always use the project's `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
  - Document user (not developer) facing changes in the ```release-note``` block. The  `release-notes.d/unreleased/*`
    file is automatically generated from the block's content - do not create the file directly. 
  - If you include a test plan section, mark passing tests with [x] so it is clear which ran and passed.
    List only new tests - indicate functionality verified, not the test names.

## Code style

- Standard Go. `make format` and `make lint` are authoritative.
- Comments are terse and only present when the WHY is non-obvious. Never paraphrase the code.
- Avoid human body-part terms in docs and comments. Use stage/step/request/pod/worker. CPU architecture terms (ARM, arm64, armv7*, armhf) are OK.
- Docs and comments describe the current state on its own terms. No "previously", "now", "recently", "renamed from", "added to fix", "this PR", "see above", or other temporal, deictic, or conversational framing. A reader with no context for the change must still understand the text.
- State each fact once, in its canonical location. Do not duplicate across struct docs, prose, tables, inline comments, and examples.
- Do not use Unicode symbols or special characters in general, unless explicitly requested.
- Do not alias an import to the name Go already infers from the package. `make lint` enforces this via revive's `redundant-import-alias`, except for version-suffixed packages (`v1`, `v1alpha1`, ...): `goimports` always writes that alias, so the rule excludes them rather than fight `make format`.

### Constructions to delete

Model-drafted prose drifts toward compressed, rhetorical phrasing. Before shipping any prose (comments, docs, commit bodies, PR descriptions), decompress it: rewrite each such sentence as a plain statement of the fact it carries, judged against what the change is actually for. The test: if a sentence sounds quotable, delete it.

| Tic | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| X, not Y | "the queue is not a buffer, it is a fairness mechanism" | say what it is, once |
| Coined aphorism | "a shed request is not a failure, it is the contract" | delete the sentence |
| Closing zinger | a paragraph that ends on a beat instead of a fact | end on information |
| Triads for rhythm | "no locks to take, no channels to drain, no state to sync" | one clause |
| Portent counters | "three things follow", "two points are worth noting" | just say them |
| Filler intensifiers | genuinely, precisely, critically, crucially, "worth noting" | cut |
| Editorial tails | "..., which is exactly what we want" | cut, or a new sentence |
| Grandeur adjectives | comprehensive, robust, seamless, production-ready | name the verified behavior |
| Dash pileup | more than one dash pair per paragraph | periods |

### Logging

The codebase uses `go-logr` via controller-runtime. Verbosity constants are defined in `pkg/common/observability/logging` (`DEFAULT=2`, `VERBOSE=3`, `DEBUG=4`, `TRACE=5`).

**Level conventions:**

- `logger.Info(...)` for once-per-request operational signals.
- `logger.V(logging.DEBUG).Info(...)` for per-item or per-loop signals that fire multiple times per request.
- `logger.V(logging.TRACE).Info(...)` for detailed state transitions (cache operations, index updates).
- `logger.Error(err, "msg", ...)` for recoverable errors that carry an underlying `error` value.

**Use named constants, not bare integers:**

```go
// wrong
logger.V(4).Info("running protocol", ...)

// correct
logger.V(logging.DEBUG).Info("running protocol", ...)
```

**Guard expensive log construction:**

```go
if v := logger.V(logging.DEBUG); v.Enabled() {
    v.Info("payload details", "data", expensiveSerialization())
}
```

## Git workflow

- DCO sign-off is required. Use `git commit -s`.
- Commit subject: imperative, ~72 characters. Body short and focused on the WHY; long narrative belongs in the PR description.
- Do not add machine-generated co-author trailers. Sign-off is the only required trailer.
- Do not bypass hooks (`--no-verify`) or signing checks.
