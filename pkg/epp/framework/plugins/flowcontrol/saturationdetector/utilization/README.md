# Utilization Detector Plugin

**Type:** `utilization-detector`

Reactive saturation detection and scheduling filter based on telemetry from LLM serving backends.

## What it does

This plugin uses a two-tier approach to manage average pool load and protect individual endpoints.

### Role in Flow Control (The Gatekeeper)
The detector implements the `SaturationDetector` interface to provide a utilization gradient, allowing the Flow Controller to apply proportional backpressure when the system is overloaded.

It relies on a "roofline model", evaluating both the queue depth and the KV cache utilization to find the most constrained resource for a given endpoint:

    EndpointScore = max(QueueDepth / QueueThreshold, KVCacheUsage / KVCacheThreshold)

The global pool saturation is then evaluated across all candidate endpoints as a gradient:

    PoolSaturation = Average(EndpointScore)

**Heterogeneous Deployments:** Because this detector calculates saturation as an unweighted average of individual endpoint scores, it treats all endpoints equally regardless of their physical capacity. In deployments with heterogeneous compute (e.g., mixing H100 and L4 nodes), a small, saturated endpoint has the exact same impact on global backpressure as a massive, saturated endpoint. Contrast this with the Concurrency Detector, which evaluates saturation as a single aggregate fraction, biasing toward larger endpoints.
*Note: Endpoints with missing or stale metrics are scored according to `stalenessPolicy`: as 100% saturated under `saturated` (default), or excluded from the pool average under `ignore`. An empty candidate list reads 1.0 under both policies.*

**Operational dependency:** under `saturated`, a fleet-wide scrape outage pins
`flow_control_pool_saturation` at 1.0 and halts dispatch entirely. The `flow_control_stale_endpoints` gauge and a
rate-limited detector log distinguish this from genuine overload: stale endpoints read exactly 1.0, while genuine
oversubscription typically reads above 1.0. `saturated` is the default because admitting blind on missing
data risks overloading model servers with no backpressure signal at all. Staleness also tends to correlate with
overload: a server too busy to serve its metrics endpoint is often the one that is saturated, so `ignore`
discounts the endpoints most likely to be overloaded from the backpressure signal. Deployments whose availability budget cannot absorb a dispatch halt
during a metrics collection outage can select `ignore`, which excludes stale endpoints from the saturation
average and scores an all-stale pool at 0.0, consistent with the Filter's fail-open fallback. Under `ignore`,
a fleet-wide scrape outage means dispatching with no backpressure signal at all; the stale-endpoints gauge and
detector log are the primary operational signal in that posture.

`stalenessPolicy` governs the `SaturationDetector` role only. The `Filter` role always drops stale candidates
and falls back to the original list when every candidate is stale, independent of this setting. Slow scrape
cadences should be tuned with `metricsStalenessThreshold` rather than `ignore`: if the poll interval is
longer than the staleness threshold, every sample reads stale between polls and `saturated` will block
dispatch almost continuously. The policy field is an enum so additional degradations (for example, holding
the last known score for a bounded window) can be added later.

### Role in Scheduling (The Traffic Shaper)
The detector implements the `Filter` interface to protect individual endpoints. It removes endpoints from candidate lists if their telemetry is stale, or if they exceed specific safety limits:

    MaxQueueLimit = QueueThreshold * (1 + Headroom)
    MaxKVCacheLimit = min(1.0, KVCacheThreshold * (1 + Headroom))

This approach allows the Flow Controller to manage average pool load, while the Scheduler retains the flexibility to burst above ideal targets (the "Headroom") to satisfy affinity or scoring objectives.

**Fail-Open Fallback:** To prevent complete routing failure, if *all* candidate endpoints are filtered out (i.e., the entire cluster is over the safety limits or stale), the filter softens and returns the original list of endpoints, allowing the scheduler's scorers to pick the least-bad option.

## Inputs consumed

The plugin consumes standard metrics from endpoints:
- `WaitingQueueSize` (Queue depth metric).
- `KVCacheUsagePercent` (KV cache utilization metric).
- `UpdateTime` (Timestamp used to calculate metric staleness).

## Configuration

The plugin accepts JSON parameters decoding to the following fields:

- `queueDepthThreshold` (`int`): Target waiting queue depth limit. Serves as the "ideal" queue capacity for a single endpoint. Must be > 0. (Default: `5`)
- `kvCacheUtilThreshold` (`float64`): Target KV cache memory utilization limit, expressed as a fraction. Must be in `(0.0, 1.0]`. (Default: `0.8`)
- `metricsStalenessThreshold` (`string` / duration): Maximum age of metrics before an endpoint is considered stale. How stale endpoints are scored is controlled by `stalenessPolicy`. Must be > 0. (Default: `"200ms"`)
- `stalenessPolicy` (`string`): How endpoints with missing or stale metrics contribute to pool saturation: `"saturated"` scores them as fully saturated; `"ignore"` excludes them from the saturation average. (Default: `"saturated"`)
- `headroom` (`float64`): Allowed burst capacity above the ideal thresholds, expressed as a fraction (e.g., `0.2` for 20%). Must be >= 0.0. (Default: `0.0`)

## Trade-offs

Unlike the Concurrency Detector, this approach operates as a closed-loop controller. It is immune to estimation divergence and reflects the actual performance limits of the continuous batching engine's memory manager. However, it suffers from two fundamental flaws of reactive systems:

1. **Telemetry Staleness (The Thundering Herd)**: Because it relies on asynchronous polling, the view of the endpoint state is perpetually delayed. A sudden burst of traffic can create a severe "thundering herd" condition, where the scheduler routes massive request volumes to a seemingly healthy endpoint before the next metric interval reveals it is completely saturated.
2. **Reactive Backpressure**: By definition, this detector only signals saturation after the inference engine is already under physical duress. It cannot preemptively shield an endpoint from an initial queue buildup; it can only throttle traffic after the physical limits have been breached and latency (TTFT/TPOT) has already degraded.
