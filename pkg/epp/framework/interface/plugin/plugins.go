// logs a warning but continues if no producer exists).

// The declared dependencies give every requestcontrol extension point a
// deterministic order: a plugin runs after the plugins producing the keys it
// consumes. Producer-before-consumer is the intended semantic on RequestHeader,
// Screen, Admit, Produce and PreRequest. ResponseHeader and ResponseBody are
// ordered the same way for determinism, but the correct direction there is
// unsettled - a producer may release consumed state in a response hook - so
// response-hook plugins must not rely on it.

// DumpState is intended for on-demand debugging snapshots of dynamic runtime
// state that is difficult to understand from metrics alone. Prefer metrics for
// numeric time series, alerting, dashboards, and aggregation over time. Dumped
// state should stay reasonably small; large or high-cardinality state should be
// summarized, capped, or omitted.
