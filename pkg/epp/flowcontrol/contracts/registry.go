// FlowRegistry is the complete interface for the global flow control plane.
// It composes all role-based interfaces. A concrete implementation of this interface is the single source of truth for
// all flow control state.
//
// # Conformance: Implementations MUST be goroutine-safe.
//
// # Flow Lifecycle
//
// A flow instance, identified by its immutable FlowKey, has a lease-based lifecycle managed by this interface.
// Any implementation MUST adhere to this lifecycle:
//
//  1. Lease Acquisition: A client calls WithConnection to acquire a lease. This signals that the flow is in use and
//     protects it from garbage collection. If the flow instance does not exist, it is created on first use.
//     Priority bands must be provisioned by the control plane before use; they are not created on the request path.
//  2. Active State: A flow is "Active" as long as its lease count is greater than zero.
//  3. Lease Release: When the WithConnection callback returns, the lease is released.
//     When the lease count drops to zero, the flow becomes "Idle".
//  4. Garbage Collection: The implementation MUST automatically garbage collect a flow after it has remained
//     continuously Idle for a configurable duration.

	// 4. Guaranteed Lease Release: It ensures the lease is safely released when the callback function returns.

	// This functional, callback-based approach makes resource leaks impossible, as the caller is not responsible for
	// manually closing the connection.
