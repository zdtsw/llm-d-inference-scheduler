# Disaggregated Inference Serving in llm-d

## Overview

This document describes the architecture and request lifecycle for enabling **disaggregated inference execution** in the llm-d Router. llm-d supports multiple disaggregation topologies:

- **EPD** (no disaggregation) – a single node handles all three functions (encode, prefill, and decode). This is the default mode when no disaggregation is configured.
- **P/D** (Prefill/Decode) – separates the prefill and decode stages onto different workers. This is functionally equivalent to EP/D, since prefill workers also handle encoding (multimodal processing) as part of the prefill stage.
- **E/PD** (Encode/Prefill-Decode) – offloads multimodal encoding to dedicated workers while a single worker handles prefill and decode.
- **E/P/D** (Encode/Prefill/Decode) – the full three-stage pipeline where each stage runs on a specialized worker.

> [!NOTE] 
> The Encode (E) stage is only relevant for requests with multimodal content (images, video, or audio). For text-only requests, the encode stage is skipped regardless of the configured topology.

> [!WARNING]
> Encode disaggregation (E/PD and E/P/D) is under active development in both vLLM and llm-d-router.
> The implementation described here is a proof of concept (PoC) and is subject to change.

All topologies are driven by the unified `disagg-profile-handler` plugin, which selects active stages based on configuration, the user request (e.g., presence of multimodal content), and the system status (e.g., KV-cache hit ratio on the selected decode pod). The architecture aims to improve flexibility, scalability, and performance by enabling separation of inference stages onto different workers.

---

## Goals

- Enable routing of encode, prefill, and decode to different workers
- Maintain low latency and high throughput
- Improve resource utilization by specializing pods for each stage
- Support multimodal workloads by offloading encoding to dedicated workers
- Align with GIE-compatible architectures for potential upstreaming

## Key Components

| Component            | Role                                                                         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encode Worker**    | Handles multimodal encoding (images, video, audio) for E/PD and E/P/D       |
| **Prefill Worker**   | Handles prefill stage using vLLM engine; in EP/D configuration, also handles encoding for multimodal requests |
| **Decode Worker**    | Handles decode stage and contains the sidecar for coordination               |
| **Sidecar (Decode)** | Orchestrates communication with encode/prefill workers and manages lifecycle |
| **Envoy Proxy**      | Accepts OpenAI-style requests and forwards them to EPP                       |
| **EPP**              | Endpoint Picker, makes scheduling decisions                                  |

## Request Lifecycle

### P/D (Prefill/Decode)

1. **User Request** – Sent via OpenAI API to the Envoy Proxy
2. **EPP Scheduling Decision** – The `disagg-profile-handler` runs stages in order:
   1. **Decode**: always runs first, selects a decode pod
   2. **Prefill** (optional): the PD decider evaluates prompt length and prefix-cache hit; if disaggregation is warranted, a prefill pod is selected
3. **Execution** – Request lands on Decode Worker:
   - If `x-prefiller-host-port` header doesn't exist → runs both stages locally
   - If `x-prefiller-host-port` header exists → sidecar sends prefill to the selected Prefill Worker, then runs decode locally
4. **Response Flow** – decode sidecar → Envoy → EPP → User

### E/PD (Encode/Prefill-Decode)

For multimodal requests (images, video, audio), the encode stage can be disaggregated to dedicated workers:

1. **User Request** – Multimodal request sent via OpenAI API
2. **EPP Scheduling Decision** – The `disagg-profile-handler` runs stages in order:
   1. **Decode**: selects a decode pod
   2. **Encode** (optional): the encode decider checks for multimodal content; if present, an encode pod is selected
3. **Execution** – Request lands on Decode Worker:
   - If encode was scheduled → sidecar sends encoding work to the selected Encode Worker(s) via the `x-encoder-hosts-ports` header
   - Encode Worker processes multimodal content and returns encoding metadata (embedding references)
   - Decode Worker reads embeddings via EC_Connector and runs prefill + decode locally
4. **Response Flow** – decode sidecar → Envoy → EPP → User

### E/P/D (Encode/Prefill/Decode)

The full three-stage pipeline combines both encode and prefill disaggregation:

1. **User Request** – Multimodal request sent via OpenAI API
2. **EPP Scheduling Decision** – The `disagg-profile-handler` runs all three stages in order:
   1. **Decode**: selects a decode pod
   2. **Encode** (optional): if multimodal content is detected, an encode pod is selected
   3. **Prefill** (optional): if the PD decider determines disaggregation is beneficial, a prefill pod is selected
3. **Execution** – Request lands on Decode Worker:
   - If encode was scheduled → sidecar sends encoding work to the selected Encode Worker(s) via the `x-encoder-hosts-ports` header
   - Encode Worker processes multimodal content and returns encoding metadata (embedding references)
   - If prefill was scheduled → sidecar sends prefill to Prefill Worker via the `x-prefiller-host-port` header
   - Prefill Worker reads embeddings via EC_Connector and executes prefill operation
   - Decode Worker runs decode locally
4. **Response Flow** – decode sidecar → Envoy → EPP → User

### Sidecar Responsibilities (Decode Only)

- Receives EPP metadata (decode pod, optional encode pod(s), optional prefill pod)
- If encode endpoints are present, sends multimodal content to Encode Worker(s), waits for results and validates them
- If prefill endpoint is present, sends prefill request to Prefill Worker, waits for results and validates them
- Launches local decode job
- Sends final response

> [!NOTE]
> No sidecar or coordination logic is needed on the prefill or encode nodes.

---

## Worker Selection Logic

- **Decode Worker**: Prefer longest prefix match / kv-cache utilization (depends on available scorers) and low load
- **Prefill Worker**: Same scoring criteria as decode
- **Encode Worker**: Selected when multimodal content is detected in the request

> **Skip prefill** when:
> - Prefix match / kv-cache hit is high
> - Prompt is very short

> **Skip encode** when:
> - Request contains no multimodal content (text-only)
> - Encode decider rejects the request

---


## Drawbacks & Limitations

- Slight increase in TTFT for disaggregated P/D and E/P/D
- Additional network hops for E/P/D (encode → prefill → decode)
- Possibility of stranded memory on prefill crash
- The need for timeout and retry logic

---

## Design Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Enables per-request specialization and resource balancing
- **Scalability**: Clean separation of concerns for easier ops and tuning
- **Upstream-ready**: Follows GIE-compatible request handling
- **Minimal Changes**: Only decode node includes orchestration sidecar

---

## Future Considerations

- Cache coordination (we can talk about 3 different types of cache: KV-cache, embeddings, and multimedia content)
- Pre-allocation of kv blocks in the decode node, push cache from the prefill to the decode worker during calculation
- More sophisticated encode worker selection (e.g., load-aware scheduling, cache content, locality-aware placement)

---

## Integrating External Prefill/Decode Workloads

The llm-d Router supports integration with external disaggregated encode/prefill/decode (E/P/D) workloads or other inference frameworks that follow the same E/P/D separation pattern but use **different Kubernetes Pod labeling conventions**.

### Labeling Convention Flexibility

By default, llm-d uses the label key `llm-d.ai/role` with values:
- `"encode"` → encode-only pods (multimodal encoding)
- `"prefill"` → prefill-only pods
- `"decode"` → decode-capable pods
- `"encode-prefill"` → pods capable of both encode and prefill (EP/D or P/D)
- `"encode-decode"` → pods capable of both encode and decode (E/PD, rare)
- `"prefill-decode"` → pods capable of both prefill and decode
- `"encode-prefill-decode"` → pods capable of all three stages

However, external systems may use alternative labels like:
```yaml
role: encode
role: prefill
role: decode
```

To accommodate this **without code changes**, you can configure the **EndpointPickerConfig** to use the generic `label-selector-filter` plugin instead of the hardcoded `encode-filter` / `prefill-filter` / `decode-filter`.

> [!NOTE]
> The previous filter type `by-label` is deprecated. Use `label-selector-filter` with standard Kubernetes label selector syntax instead.

## Deciders

Deciders are handler plugins responsible for determining whether a disaggregated stage should be executed for a given request.

### PD Deciders

PD deciders determine whether prefill should be offloaded to a separate worker, based on the properties of the request prompt.

#### Prefix-Based PD Decider

The `prefix-based-pd-decider` plugin compares the request's non-cached suffix on the selected decode endpoint against a threshold. Which role the plugin fills depends on the deployment topology:

- **Sidecar-based P/D deployments** wire the plugin as a `disagg-profile-handler` decider — it routes prefill remotely when the threshold is met (see [Profile Handler Configuration](#profile-handler-configuration)). Sidecar deployments do not emit `Prefer: if-available`, so the conditional-decode gate is dormant here.
- **Coordinator-based deployments** use the default profile handler and declare the plugin at the top level. Only its `PreRequest` hook runs, enforcing the conditional-decode gate — `Prefer: if-available` requests are rejected with HTTP 412 when the same threshold would trigger remote prefill.

Both roles read the same `nonCachedTokens` / `promptTokens` parameters. Declaring **two named instances** of this plugin in the same config (e.g., one wired as a decider, another as a standalone gate) with different parameters is not supported: the plugin memoizes its per-request decision keyed by plugin type, so the first instance to evaluate a given request populates the cache and the second reads that cached decision — its own parameters silently do not apply.

**How It Works**
- Once a decode pod is selected, the decider checks how many tokens from the incoming prompt have already been sent to this pod

- If the prompt length is shorter than the configured prompt length threshold (promptTokens), the full request runs locally on the decode worker without remote prefill

- If the remaining non-cached suffix length is at least the configured threshold (nonCachedTokens), disaggregation is triggered: the prefill will run remotely on a prefill pod, and decode locally on the decode pod

- If the non-cached suffix is shorter than the threshold, the full request runs locally on the decode worker without remote prefill

**Configuration**
```yaml
- type: prefix-based-pd-decider
  parameters:
    nonCachedTokens: 8
    promptTokens: 0
```

**Parameter:**

- `nonCachedTokens`: Non-cached suffix length in tokens at which the plugin's gate fires — triggering disaggregation for normal requests, or returning HTTP 412 Precondition Failed for `Prefer: if-available` requests. `0` disables both.
- `promptTokens`: Minimum prompt length in tokens before the plugin's routing and gating logic applies. Prompts shorter than this run locally on the decode worker without remote prefill; the 412 gate honors the same shortcut. `0` disables it.
- `prefixMatchInfoProducerName`: Name of the prefix-cache producer whose cache state the decider reads for both the disaggregation decision and the conditional-decode 412 gate. If unspecified, the `approx-prefix-cache-producer` is used.

**Conditional-decode 412 gate**

Requests carrying `Prefer: if-available` (used by the coordinator's speculative early-decode step, see [coordinator_architecture.md](coordinator_architecture.md)) are gated by the plugin using the same `promptTokens` / `nonCachedTokens` thresholds as the disaggregation decision: when the chosen decode endpoint's non-cached suffix would trigger remote prefill, the plugin returns HTTP 412 Precondition Failed so the coordinator restarts the pipeline at encode/prefill/decode. Cache state is read as unweighted contiguous blocks, so a RAM-cached prefix contributes its full token count.

Deployments that do not declare any conditional-decode gate plugin still reject `Prefer: if-available` requests: the director rejects unclaimed conditional-decode requests with 412 by default so a missing gate plugin surfaces as the coordinator's cache-miss fallback rather than a silent forward.

A minimal coordinator-topology configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: llm-d.ai/v1alpha1
kind: EndpointPickerConfig
plugins:
  - type: token-producer
  - type: approx-prefix-cache-producer
  - type: prefix-cache-scorer
  - type: max-score-picker
  - type: prefix-based-pd-decider
    parameters:
      nonCachedTokens: 8
schedulingProfiles:
  - name: decode
    plugins:
      - pluginRef: "prefix-cache-scorer"
      - pluginRef: "max-score-picker"
```

The plugin declares `PrefixCacheMatchInfo` and `TokenizedPrompt` as required dependencies, so a missing producer surfaces as a startup error rather than a silent per-request forward.

Full P/D and E/P/D configurations that combine the decider and gate roles are in [Configuration Examples](#configuration-examples).

#### Always-Disagg PD Decider
The `always-disagg-pd-decider` is a simpler alternative used mainly for testing or benchmarking.
It always triggers disaggregation, regardless of prefix cache state or prompt characteristics.

**Configuration example:**

```yaml
- type: always-disagg-pd-decider
```

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin accepts no parameters.

It’s useful for validating end-to-end prefill/decode splitting and comparing system performance under forced disaggregation.

### Encode Deciders

Encode deciders determine whether multimodal encoding should be offloaded to dedicated encode workers.

#### Always Disagg Multimodal Decider

The `always-disagg-multimodal-decider` triggers encode disaggregation whenever the request contains multimodal content (images, video, or audio). Text-only requests are never sent to encode workers.

**Configuration example:**

```yaml
- type: always-disagg-multimodal-decider
```

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin accepts no parameters.

It checks for the presence of `image_url`, `audio_url`, `video_url`, or `input_audio` content blocks in the chat-completions request body. If any multimodal content is found, the encode stage is activated.

---

## Profile Handler Configuration

The `disagg-profile-handler` plugin is the entry point for all disaggregation topologies. Active stages are determined by which deciders are configured.

### Parameters

- `stageOrder` (optional, default: `decode-first`): order of execution for disaggregation stages.
  - `decode-first`: Decode runs first, followed by Encode (optional) and Prefill (optional). The PD decider inspects the chosen decode pod's cache state to determine whether prefill should be disaggregated.
  - `prefill-first`: Prefill runs first, followed by Encode (optional) and Decode. When the prefill profile is configured, prefill always runs, and the chosen prefill pod is published so the decode stage can apply topology affinity constraints (e.g., co-locating decode on the same rack).
- `profiles` (optional): names of the scheduling profiles to use.
  - `decode` (default: `decode`)
  - `prefill` (default: `prefill`)
  - `encode` (default: `encode`)
- `deciders` (optional): decider plugins that control whether each stage runs.
  - `prefill`: enables P/D disaggregation when set (used in `decode-first` mode).
  - `encode`: enables E disaggregation when set.

### Examples

#### Decode-only (no disaggregation)

No deciders are configured -- all requests are handled by the decode profile alone.

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
```

#### P/D (Prefill/Decode, Decode-First)

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    deciders:
      prefill: prefix-based-pd-decider
```

Custom profile names (if your scheduling profiles are not named `decode`/`prefill`):

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    profiles:
      decode: my-decode
      prefill: my-prefill
    deciders:
      prefill: prefix-based-pd-decider
```

#### P/D (Prefill/Decode, Prefill-First)

In `prefill-first` mode, prefill runs first without requiring a PD decider, and publishes the selected prefill endpoint so subsequent decode scheduling can match against it (e.g., via topology affinity).

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    stageOrder: prefill-first
```

#### E/PD (Encode/Prefill-Decode)

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    deciders:
      encode: always-disagg-multimodal-decider
```

#### E/P/D (Encode/Prefill/Decode)

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    deciders:
      prefill: prefix-based-pd-decider
      encode: always-disagg-multimodal-decider
```

## Sidecar Configuration

The decode sidecar proxy is responsible for coordinating KV cache transfers between vLLM instances during disaggregated inference. It must be configured with the correct connector protocol matching the vLLM `kv_connector` used on the serving pods.

### KV Connector (`--kv-connector`)

Specifies which KV transfer protocol the sidecar uses to coordinate prefill/decode disaggregation. This flag corresponds to the vLLM-side `kv_connector` value set in `--kv-transfer-config` on the serving pods, but uses its own naming convention.

| `--kv-connector` value | vLLM `kv_connector` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `nixlv2` (default) | `NixlConnector` | NIXL-based KV transfer using RDMA/GPU-direct |
| `shared-storage` | `SharedStorageConnector` | KV transfer via shared filesystem |
| `sglang` | — | SGLang disaggregation protocol |
| `mooncake` | `MooncakeConnector` | [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake) KV transfer using RDMA |
| `offloading` | `OffloadingConnector` | KV transfer over the vLLM CPU offloading tier. The decoder pulls KV from the prefiller via the `p2p` secondary tier. |

With `offloading`, the sidecar dispatches prefill and decode concurrently. It
injects role-keyed `kv_transfer_params`, each key named for the remote party it
describes: the prefiller receives `{"remote_decoder": {"kv_request_id": <id>}}`
(no peer address), and the decoder receives `{"remote_prefiller":
{"kv_request_id": <id>, "remote_host": <prefiller host>, "remote_port":
<p2p-connector-port>}}` so it can pull KV from the prefiller. The prefiller host
comes from the `x-prefiller-host-port` header; the port is
`--p2p-connector-port`.

When the request also carries the `x-kv-cache-source-host-port` header (set by
the EPP `p2p-source-producer` to a peer holding more cached prefix than the pod
computing the prefix), the sidecar injects an additional `remote_kv_source` key
so vLLM pulls that cached prefix over the P2P tier instead of recomputing it.
Under disaggregation the prefill request carries `{"remote_decoder": {...},
"remote_kv_source": {"kv_request_id": <own id>, "remote_host": <source host>,
"remote_port": <p2p-connector-port>}}` (the only supported multi-key
combination); without a prefiller the decoder-only request carries
`{"remote_kv_source": {...}}` alone. A malformed or disallowed source header is
ignored and the request proceeds unchanged, as is any source header on a
connector that cannot pull over the P2P tier: only `offloading`, or NIXLv2 with
`--enable-p2p-pull`, honors it. For the pulled blocks to be servable, the source
pod must offload its generated (decode-phase) KV: set `offload_prompt_only:
false` in its `kv_connector_extra_config` (the default `true` offloads only
prefill blocks).

Both prefill and decode pods require the following `--kv-transfer-config`:

```json
{
  "kv_connector": "OffloadingConnector",
  "kv_role": "kv_both",
  "kv_connector_extra_config": {
    "spec_name": "TieringOffloadingSpec",
    "cpu_bytes_to_use": <bytes>,
    "secondary_tiers": [{"type": "p2p", "host": "<POD_IP>", "port": <p2p-connector-port>}]
  }
}
```

`host` must be the pod's own IP at runtime (use the Kubernetes downward API env var `status.podIP`). `port` must match `--p2p-connector-port` (default `7777`) when each pod is a complete DP group; wide-EP worker pods instead set the compensated `P2P_BASE` (see the wide-EP paragraph below). `cpu_bytes_to_use` controls the CPU KV offload buffer size; size it to hold the KV for the expected concurrent in-flight transfers. `OffloadingConnector` is available in vLLM nightly builds from 2026-06-30 onward (commit `bec232a`, [PR #42285](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/42285)).

**Data parallelism:** the P2P tier supports `--data-parallel-size` N > 1 when
each pod is a complete DP group (the per-pod DP deployment), or a multi-pod
(wide-EP) group with compensated socket bases (below).

- vLLM gives each DP replica its own P2P listener and offload region:
  replica `i` serves on `<p2p-connector-port>+i`, where `i` is the
  **global** `data_parallel_index`
  ([PR #47636](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/47636),
  [PR #47987](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/47987)). Engines
  without those changes bind every replica to the same
  `POD_IP:<p2p-connector-port>`, and DP > 1 fails at engine startup.
- The sidecar serves rank `r` on its own port + `r`, so the routed
  endpoint's port names the target rank. The sidecar injects
  `remote_port` = `--p2p-connector-port` + `r`; a port outside the rank
  range falls back to rank 0.
- The endpoint port encodes the pod-local rank, which matches the global
  index only when the pod is a whole DP group. Multi-pod DP groups (for
  example LWS wide-EP, where pod `k`'s replicas hold global indices
  `k*N..k*N+N-1` behind the same serving ports) must compensate the
  configured socket base ports per pod; see the wide-EP example below.
- Every replica maps its own offload region, so the pod's `/dev/shm` must
  exceed N x `cpu_bytes_to_use`.

**Wide-EP (multi-pod DP groups):** vLLM adds the **global**
`data_parallel_index` to the configured P2P and KV-events base ports, while
the router addresses an engine by pod IP plus **pod-local** rank. Each pod
must therefore subtract its global start rank from both configured bases so
every pod binds the same pod-local ranges and the serving-port offset again
names the target rank. In an LWS template with `DP_SIZE_LOCAL` ranks per
pod:

```bash
START_RANK=$(( ${LWS_WORKER_INDEX:-0} * DP_SIZE_LOCAL ))
P2P_BASE=$((7777 - START_RANK))
KV_EVENTS_BASE=$((5557 - START_RANK))
```

`P2P_BASE` is the P2P secondary tier port:

```json
"secondary_tiers": [{"type": "p2p", "host": "${POD_IP}", "port": ${P2P_BASE}}]
```

`KV_EVENTS_BASE` is the KV-events publisher endpoint
(`"endpoint": "tcp://*:${KV_EVENTS_BASE}"`), so the EPP's per-rank
subscribers (`precise-prefix-cache-producer` dials
`podDiscoveryConfig.socketPort` + rank index) reach each rank's socket.
With `DP_SIZE_LOCAL: 8` every pod binds P2P `7777-7784`, KV events
`5557-5564`, and serving `8000-8007`. Only the socket bases are
compensated; `data_parallel_index` and the global rank carried in KV-event
batches are unchanged.

### General Sidecar Flags

| Flag | Env var | Values | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--enable-tls` | — | `prefiller`, `decoder`, `encoder` (comma-separated or repeated) | none | Enable TLS for the specified stages. Example: `--enable-tls=prefiller,decoder` |
| `--tls-insecure-skip-verify` | — | `prefiller`, `decoder`, `encoder` (comma-separated or repeated) | none | Skip TLS certificate verification for the specified stages. Example: `--tls-insecure-skip-verify=prefiller` |
| `--enable-prefiller-sampling` | `ENABLE_PREFILLER_SAMPLING` | `true` / `false` | `false` | If true, the prefill instance is selected randomly from the provided prefill host values. |
| `--enable-ssrf-protection` | — | `true` / `false` | `false` | Enable SSRF protection using InferencePool allowlisting. |

### Connector-Specific Flags

| Connector | Flag | Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mooncake` | `--mooncake-bootstrap-port` | `MOONCAKE_BOOTSTRAP_PORT` | `8998` | Port used to query the Mooncake bootstrap endpoint on prefill pods. Corresponds to vLLM's `VLLM_MOONCAKE_BOOTSTRAP_PORT`. |
| `sglang` | — | `SGLANG_BOOTSTRAP_PORT` | `8998` | Port used for the SGLang bootstrap endpoint on prefill pods. |
| `offloading` | `--p2p-connector-port` | `P2P_CONNECTOR_PORT` | `7777` | Prefiller's OffloadingConnector P2P tier listening port (rank-0 port under data parallelism), injected as `remote_port` on the decode request so the decoder can pull KV. |
| `nixlv2` | `--enable-p2p-pull` | — | `false` | Declare the OffloadingConnector P2P tier available for cached-prefix pulls when the PD connector is NIXLv2, i.e. the engines run `MultiConnector(NixlConnector + OffloadingConnector)`. NIXL moves KV prefill to decode while the OffloadingConnector pulls the cached prefix named by `x-kv-cache-source-host-port`. Rejected at startup with any other connector; `offloading` provides the tier natively and needs no flag. |
